BlitTris
========

BlitTris is a Tetris-like game for the awesome 32blit handheld console.

It's an evolution from my DragonRuby-based (dragontt)[https://ahnlak.itch.io/dragontt],
which in turn was inspired (many decades removed!) by Mirk's (Tetris for Terminals)[https://github.com/MikeTaylor/tt]

This is a more rounded game than `dragontt`, which was ultimately just a way
of exploring the magnificent DragonRuby environment. Here, we can offer the
full range of tetronimoes found in the depths of later versions of `tt`, and
some other refinements.

My aim is to have this release ready in time for the public launch of the 32blit.

This project is released under the MIT License; browse, explore the code, pull
it apart and put it back together again. Learn. Discover. Find out how even
badly written code can produce an awesome game!

Share And Enjoy.
